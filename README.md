## btclustering -- A package for clustering based on binary tree.

This packgae is adapted from the Julia Package [DecitionTree](https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl). 
Currently btclustering provide clustering on both numeric and category data.   

The main function is `build_tree` which fits a multiresponse regression or classification tree taking the 
same dataset as both responses and features. So this function can also be used as as a multiple response version
regression and classification tree method.
